Add the module `ionic-fly-cart` to your application dependencies in your `app.js`:
`angular.module('starter', ['ionic', 'ionic-speed-dial'])`

And you're ready to go.

## Directives
There are two directives which are used in this template .

### add-to-cart-fly-btn
E.g. <add-to-cart-fly-btn>Add to cart</add-to-cart-fly-btn>
By clicking on this you can fly the image element of its parent .

### add-to-cart-fly-container
The cart container to which the image will fly .
E.g. `<add-to-cart-fly-container top="" right="" funhandler="cartClick();"></add-to-cart-fly-container>` 
You can dynamically set the position by passing top and right value of directive.
Also you can handle the container click event in your controller by defining `cartClick` Function.
